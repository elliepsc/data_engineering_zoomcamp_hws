# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026 Homeworks
**Student:** Ellie Pascaud
**Course:** Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026
**Database:** NYC taxi dataset


## Project Structure
The project follows the Zoomcamp and is organized by module, covering the full data engineering lifecycle: ingestion, orchestration, warehousing, and analytics.

## Course Overview
- **Module 1:** Docker & Terraform
    Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and containerized environments using Docker.
- **Module 2:** Workflow orchestration
    Building and scheduling data pipelines with Apache Airflow.
- **Module 3:** Data Warehouse (with GCP)
    Cloud-based data warehousing using Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery.
- **Module 4:** Analytics engineering (with Dbt)
    Data transformations, testing, and modeling using dbt.
- **Module 5:** Data Platforms (with Airflow & GCP)
    Data cycle: ingestion, transformation, orchestration, quality, management (lineage, documentation)
